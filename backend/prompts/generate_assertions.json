Break down each criterion to identify its core components.\n2. **Break Down Criteria**: For each identified component, think about specific, detailed aspects or actions that fulfill or support the high-level goal.\n3. **Formulate Assertions**: Write low-level assertions that are specific, measurable, and relevant. These assertions should be detailed enough to assess their fulfillment in practical scenarios.\n4. **Review and Refine**: Ensure assertions are clear, concise, and aligned with the initial high-level criteria. Remove any ambiguity or overlap between assertions. Each assertion should be a statement that should be answered with a yes or a no.\n5. Provide a **minimum of three positive** and **three negative examples** for the criteria. The examples should vary in complexity, user input types, and context.\n\n\n# Output Format\njson```\n[\n  {\n    \"CRITERION_NAME\": \"<A descriptive short name for the criterion>\",\n    \"DEFINITION\": \"<A definition explaining the purpose of this criterion and what aspect of the bot's performance it is evaluating>\",\n    \"ASSERTIONS\": [\n      {\n        \"NAME\": \"<The name of a specific assertion that tests the criterion>\",\n        \"DESCRIPTION\": \"<A brief explanation of what this assertion is testing>\",\n\"EXAMPLES\": [\n          {\n            \"input\": \"<A sample user input that the bot would receive>\",\n            \"output\": \"<The bot's expected response to the input>\",\n            \"result\": \"pass\",\n            \"reason\": \"<Explanation for why this is a pass example (e.g., bot successfully captured all required information, handled the user request correctly)>\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"input\": \"<A sample user input that the bot would receive>\",\n            \"output\": \"<The bot's actual response to the input>\",\n            \"result\": \"fail\",\n            \"reason\": \"<Explanation for why this is a fail example (e.g., bot missed critical information, gave incorrect or incomplete response)>\"\n          }\n        ]\n       \n      },\n      {\n        \"NAME\": \"<Another specific assertion>\",\n        \"DESCRIPTION\": \"<What aspect of the criterion this assertion tests>\",\n\"EXAMPLES\": [\n          {\n            \"input\": \"<A sample user input that the bot would receive>\",\n            \"output\": \"<The bot's expected response to the input>\",\n            \"result\": \"pass\",\n            \"reason\": \"<Explanation for why this is a pass example (e.g., bot successfully captured all required information, handled the user request correctly)>\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"input\": \"<A sample user input that the bot would receive>\",\n            \"output\": \"<The bot's actual response to the input>\",\n            \"result\": \"fail\",\n            \"reason\": \"<Explanation for why this is a fail example (e.g., bot missed critical information, gave incorrect or incomplete response)>\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n \n  }\n]\n```\n- A structured list of low-level assertions for each high-level criterion.\n- Output as a markdown list, with each high-level criterion containing its associated assertions indented beneath it.\n\n\n"
