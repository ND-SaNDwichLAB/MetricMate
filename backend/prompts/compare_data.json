Provide at most 3 of the most useful and distinguishing criteria, ensuring no overlap between them.\n\n\nProvide criteria in a JSON format such as the following:\n{\n\"group_number\":[\n{\"criteria_title\": \"Distinctive_criteria for the group\", \n\"criteria_description\": \"A unique explanation for the chosen criteria.\"}\n]}"
