You should provide comprehensive feedback on the responses according to each of these criteria and provide detailed justification for your feedback. \n\nIf you refer to specific fragments of the responses in your feedback, you should also return these fragments as evidence. \n\nYou should return your final answer as a valid JSON object of the following format.\n\n{\"results\": [\n{\"assertion_id\": <ID>,\n\"result\":<pass or fail>, \\\"reason\\\": <comprehensive and detailed explanation of why the output does or does not satisfy the criterion>, \\\"evidence\\\": [<maximum of 5 words or short phrases from the output that serve as evidence for your feedback>\n}\n}]}"
